= Rubberband routing of PCB traces

== Fully experimental work with no real use!

This is a port of my old initial version from
http://ssalewski.de/Router.html.en
to Nim language.

Instead of using the CGAL library for the constrained delaunay triangulation and the
CGAL Apollonius graph for determining the convex hull of disks, for both
now pure Nim libs are used. And instead of a fibonacci queue from BOOST
library as priority queue we now use the heapqueue from the Nim standard library.

Of course this router is useless as its own, but it may become an important core component
of a EDA (electronic design automation) tool.

To compile the code, a slightly modified version of the CDT library and a
QuickHullOfDisk module are necessary, both should ship to github in the next
months.
